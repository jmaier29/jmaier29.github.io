    "text": "With the nfl draft just weeks away, it’s officially mock draft season. There seems to be a cliche over the last few years that you shouldn’t draft a running back in the first round. But just how true is that assumption. Are first round running backs worth it?\nLet’s dive into some data to see.\nFirst off, when talking about first round running backs, we’ll only focus on players playing on the team that originally drafted them. Once players go elsewhere, the organization that drafted them no longer reaps the benefits of using a pick on them.\nThe goal of every NFL teams is to win games. So does drafting a running back in the first round directly correlate to victories? Not so much.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"nfldraftrbtckl.csv\") %>% filter(Season >2001 ) %>% rename(FirstRoundRB = RB1) %>% rename(FirstRoundTackle = TKL1)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draft, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W, fill=FirstRoundRB)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"blue\")) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n       title=\"First round running backs rarely contribute to winning teams\", \n    subtitle=\"Since 2002, only six NFL teams have had a first round running back they drafted on their roster in over \nhalf of their total wins.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to win games, running back may not be the way to go in the first round. Notice how most of the good teams over the last 20 years didn’t roster a first round running back often.\nSo what other position should we prioritize? Quarterback is obvious, but we don’t want to be drafting one of those every year. Let’s see how offensive tackles stack up compared to running backs in the winning department.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draft, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W, fill=FirstRoundTackle)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"darkgreen\")) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n       title=\"First round offensive tackles help their teams much more\", \n    subtitle=\"A much larger portion of the NFL's total wins came with a first round tackle on the roster since 2002\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst round big men up front play for winning teams much more often. But it is a team sport, and one position can’t directly decide the outcome of games. The more a player plays, though, the more they can help their team win.\nSo how often are first round running backs starters on their team? Surprisingly, more as of late.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"finalprojecttest2.csv\")\nrunningbacks <- read_csv(\"draft.csv\")\ntackles <- read_csv(\"tackledraft.csv\")\n\nrbretired <- runningbacks %>% filter(Rnd < 2, To <2022,From > 2002)\nrbAll <- runningbacks %>%filter(Rnd < 2, From >2002)\ntretired <- tackles %>% filter(Rnd < 2, To < 2022, From >2002)\ntAll <- tackles %>% filter(Rnd < 2, From >2002)\n\nRBStPerYr <- rbAll  %>% mutate(YearsPlayed = (To-From + 1)) %>% mutate(StartingYearsPerYearPlayed = (St/YearsPlayed)) %>% mutate(StartsPerYear = (GS/YearsPlayed))\n\nTStPerYr <- tAll  %>% mutate(YearsPlayed = (To-From + 1)) %>% mutate(StartingYearsPerYearPlayed = (St/YearsPlayed)) %>% mutate(StartsPerYear = (GS/YearsPlayed))\n\nRBStPerYrRetired <- RBStPerYr %>% filter(To < 2022)\n\nTStPerYrRetired <- TStPerYr %>% filter(To < 2022)\n\nRBStPerYrOld <- RBStPerYr %>% filter(From < 2016)\n\nTStPerYrOld <- TStPerYr %>% filter(From< 2016)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= RBStPerYr, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color= \"Active\")) +\n   geom_point(data= RBStPerYrRetired, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color = \"Retired/Free Agent\")) +  \n geom_smooth(data=RBStPerYr, aes(x=Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed), method=\"lm\") +\n   scale_color_manual(name=\"Status\", values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Draft Year\", \n    y=\"% of Total Seasons Being a Starter\", \n    title=\"Running backs have begun to start more of their total seasons\", \n    subtitle=\"But it's not consistent, and the predictive model is inflated by younger players that\nhaven't retired yet.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() + \n      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe younger running backs have been consistent starters, but it’s probably too early to judge their full careers yet. If the retired players tell us anything, we can expect first round running backs to start an average around 50% of their total seasons. So how do offensive tackles compare?\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= TStPerYr, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color= \"Active\")) +\n   geom_point(data= TStPerYrRetired, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color = \"Retired/Free Agent\")) +  \n geom_smooth(data=TStPerYr, aes(x=Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed), method=\"lm\") +\n   scale_color_manual(name=\"Status\", values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Draft Year\", \n    y=\"% of Total Seasons Being a Starter\", \n    title=\"First Round Offensive Tackles are usually career starters\", \n    subtitle=\"Despite the slight downtick, the predictive model consistantly hovers around 75% of total \nseasons being a starter.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() +\n      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n    ) \n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predictive model is trending down, but the data is much more consistent. Look how much higher the retired tackles cluster is here than the previous tackle. If you want a player that is going to start most of his games, offensive tackle is the way to go."

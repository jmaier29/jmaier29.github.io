    "text": "With the nfl draft just weeks away, it’s officially mock draft season. There seems to be a cliche over the last few years that you shouldn’t draft a running back in the first round. But just how true is that assumption. Are first round running backs worth it?\nLet’s dive into some data to see.\nFirst off, when talking about first round running backs, we’ll only focus on players playing on the team that originally drafted them. Once players go elsewhere, the organization that drafted them no longer reaps the benefits of using a pick on them.\nThe goal of every NFL teams is to win games. So does drafting a running back in the first round directly correlate to victories? Not so much.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.2 ──\n✔ ggplot2 3.4.0      ✔ purrr   1.0.1 \n✔ tibble  3.2.1      ✔ dplyr   1.0.10\n✔ tidyr   1.2.1      ✔ stringr 1.5.0 \n✔ readr   2.1.3      ✔ forcats 0.5.2 \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"nfldraftrbtckl.csv\") %>% filter(Season >2001 ) %>% rename(FirstRoundRB = RB1) %>% rename(FirstRoundTackle = TKL1)\n\n\nNew names:\nRows: 734 Columns: 16\n── Column specification\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Delimiter: \",\" chr\n(5): Team, RB1, TKL1, Conf, Div dbl (11): Rk, Season, G...4, G...5, W, L, T,\nW-L%, Pts, PtsO, PtDif\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data. ℹ\nSpecify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n• `G` -> `G...4`\n• `G` -> `G...5`\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draft, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W, fill=FirstRoundRB)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"blue\")) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Wins\", \n       title=\"First round running backs rarely contribute to winning teams\", \n    subtitle=\"Since 2002, only six NFL teams have had a first round running back they drafted on their roster in over \nhalf of their total wins.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )"

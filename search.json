    "section": "",
    "text": "With the NFL draft just weeks away, it’s officially mock draft season. It’s also that time of year when both fans and so-called draft experts debate the respective value of each position.\nOver the last several years, first-round running backs in particular have been the object of much discussion. Is drafting a running back in the first round worth it? The answer has largely been no. But just how true is that assumption? Is it based on measurable statistics?\nLet’s dive into some data to see for ourselves.\nFirst off, when talking about first-round running backs, we’ll only focus on players playing on the team that originally drafted them. Once players go elsewhere, their original team no longer reaps the benefits of using a pick on them.\nWhy do NFL teams care about drafting good players? Winning games of course. So does drafting a running back in the first round directly correlate to victories? Not so much.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(waffle)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"nfldraftrbtckl.csv\") %>% filter(Season >2001 ) %>% rename(FirstRoundRB = RB1) %>% rename(FirstRoundTackle = TKL1)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draft, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W, fill=FirstRoundRB)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"#0047AB\")) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Total Wins Since 2002\", \n       title=\"First round running backs rarely contribute to winning teams\", \n    subtitle=\"Since 2002, only six NFL teams have had a first-round running back that they drafted on their roster \nin over half their total wins.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to win games, running back may not be the way to go in the first round. Notice how most of the best teams over the last 20 years rarely rostered a first-round running back.\nSo what other position should we prioritize instead? Quarterback is obvious, but we don’t want to be drafting one of those every year. Let’s see how first-round offensive tackles stack up in the winning department.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=draft, aes(x=reorder(Team, W), weight=W, fill=FirstRoundTackle)) + \n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"grey\", \"darkgreen\")) +\n    labs(\n    x=\"Team\", \n    y=\"Total Wins Since 2002\", \n       title=\"First-round offensive tackles help their teams much more\", \n    subtitle=\"A much larger portion of the NFL's total wins came with a first-round tackle on the roster since 2002\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst-round big men play for winning teams much more often. But it’s a team sport, and one position can’t directly decide the outcome of games. The more a player plays, though, the more they can benefit their team.\nSo how often are first-round running backs starters on their teams? Surprisingly, more often as of late.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"finalprojecttest2.csv\")\nrunningbacks <- read_csv(\"draft.csv\")\ntackles <- read_csv(\"tackledraft.csv\")\n\nrbretired <- runningbacks %>% filter(Rnd < 2, To <2022,From > 2002)\nrbAll <- runningbacks %>%filter(Rnd < 2, From >2002)\ntretired <- tackles %>% filter(Rnd < 2, To < 2022, From >2002)\ntAll <- tackles %>% filter(Rnd < 2, From >2002)\n\nRBStPerYr <- rbAll  %>% mutate(YearsPlayed = (To-From + 1)) %>% mutate(StartingYearsPerYearPlayed = (St/YearsPlayed)) %>% mutate(StartsPerYear = (GS/YearsPlayed))\n\nTStPerYr <- tAll  %>% mutate(YearsPlayed = (To-From + 1)) %>% mutate(StartingYearsPerYearPlayed = (St/YearsPlayed)) %>% mutate(StartsPerYear = (GS/YearsPlayed))\n\nRBStPerYrRetired <- RBStPerYr %>% filter(To < 2022)\n\nTStPerYrRetired <- TStPerYr %>% filter(To < 2022)\n\nRBStPerYrOld <- RBStPerYr %>% filter(From < 2016)\n\nTStPerYrOld <- TStPerYr %>% filter(From< 2016)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= RBStPerYr, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color= \"Active\")) +\n   geom_point(data= RBStPerYrRetired, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color = \"Retired/Free Agent\")) +  \n geom_smooth(data=RBStPerYr, aes(x=Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed), method=\"lm\") +\n   scale_color_manual(name=\"Status\", values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Draft Year\", \n    y=\"% of Total Seasons Being a Starter\", \n    title=\"Running backs have begun to start more\", \n    subtitle=\"But it's not consistent, and the predictive model is inflated by younger players that\nhaven't retired yet.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() + \n      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe younger running backs have been consistent starters, but it’s probably too early to judge their full careers yet. If the retired players tell us anything, we can expect first-round running backs to start around 50% of their total seasons on average. Let’s compare that to offensive tackles.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= TStPerYr, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color= \"Active\")) +\n   geom_point(data= TStPerYrRetired, aes(x= Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed, color = \"Retired/Free Agent\")) +  \n geom_smooth(data=TStPerYr, aes(x=Year, y= StartingYearsPerYearPlayed), method=\"lm\") +\n   scale_color_manual(name=\"Status\", values=c(\"grey\", \"red\")) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Draft Year\", \n    y=\"% of Total Seasons Being a Starter\", \n    title=\"First-round offensive tackles are usually career starters\", \n    subtitle=\"Despite the slight downtick, the predictive model consistantly hovers around 75% of total \nseasons being a starter.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() +\n      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n    ) \n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nThe predictive model is trending down, but the data is much more consistent. Look how much higher the retired tackles cluster is here than in the previous chart. If you want a player who will be a starter in most of his total seasons, tackle is the way to go.\nBut that doesn’t give us the whole story. What if someone played just one season, but was a starter during it? That wouldn’t justify a first-round selection.\nSo let’s strip this data down solely for total seasons being a starter.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() +\n  geom_point(data= RBStPerYrOld, aes(x= Year, y= St, color= \"Running Backs\")) +\n   geom_point(data= TStPerYrOld, aes(x= Year, y= St, color = \"Offensive Tackles\")) +  \n  geom_hline(yintercept=6.930233, color=\"#50C878\") +\n    geom_hline(yintercept=4.517241      , color=\"#0047AB\") +\n   scale_color_manual(name=\"Position\", values=c(\"#50C878\", \"#0047AB\")) +  \n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(2002, 2015)) +\n    \n  labs(\n    x=\"Draft Year\", \n    y=\"Seasons being a Starter\", \n    title=\"Drafting a first-round offensive tackle is the safer bet\", \n    subtitle=\"Among players drafted between 2002-2015, only five first-round running backs \nstarted more seasons than the average for first-round offensive tackles\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nTackles are starters for more seasons on average, nearly a 2 1/2 season advantage over first-round running backs.\nEnough about tackles, though, we’re focused on running backs. We need running backs on our roster, so what round should we draft them in?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggbeeswarm)\nlibrary(gt)\n\ndraft <- read_csv(\"nfldraftrbtckl.csv\") %>% filter(Season>2001)\nrunningbacks <- read_csv(\"draft.csv\") %>% mutate(YearsPlayed = (To-From + 1)) %>% filter(YearsPlayed>0)\nbeeswarmrb <- runningbacks %>% filter(St>0)\n\navg1RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 1) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd1avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n  \navg2RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 2) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd2avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\navg3RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 3) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd3avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\navg4RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 4) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd4avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\navg5RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 5) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd5avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\navg6RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 6) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd6avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\navg7RB <- runningbacks %>% \n  ungroup() %>% filter(Rnd == 7) %>% \n  mutate(Rnd7avg = mean(YearsPlayed)) \n\nggplot() + \n\n geom_beeswarm(data=beeswarmrb, aes(x=Rnd, y=YearsPlayed), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_point(data=avg1RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd1avg), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg2RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd2avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg3RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd3avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg4RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd4avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg5RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd5avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg6RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd6avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n   geom_point(data=avg7RB, aes(x=Rnd, y=Rnd7avg ), color=\"blue\") +\n\n labs(\n    x=\"Draft Round\", \n    y=\"Years Played\", \n    title=\"First round running backs don't last much longer\", \n    subtitle=\"Since 2002, there's less than a four year difference in average career length between first round\nrunning backs and seventh round running backs\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nTo be fair, there’s a noticeable drop off in average career length from round one to round two. On average, a running back will play .5 fewer years per round he’s drafted in after the first round.\nDoes that justify drafting a running back in the first round? That’s up to you. But it’s certainly not as bad of a decision as many have made it seem."

Their 2023 27-0 playoff choke against the Jaguars is just the latest in a long line of catastrophic failures. What’s worse is the complete waste of three hall-of-fame potential careers, LaDainian Tomlinson, Antonio Gates and Phillip Rivers. The dynamic trio won just three playoff games together.\nThe 2010 Chargers’ season perfectly embodies the aura of the team. That’s the year they had the best offense and best defense in the NFL, but managed to miss the playoffs with a 9-7 record. Yep, you heard that right.

A few teams rank close to them on either offense or defense, but combined, the Chargers are in a league of their own.\nBut yards don’t always translate into points. They could have marched down the field with ease but struggled to cash drives in for touchdowns. Surprisingly, the Chargers actually performed well on the scorebord too.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=differential, aes(x=reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"lightgrey\") +\n  geom_bar(data=playoffteamsdifferential, aes(x=reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"lightblue\") +\n   geom_bar(data=chargersdifferential, aes(x=reorder(Tm, PD), weight=PD), fill= \"#1167b1\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n \n  labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Yards\", \n    y=\"Yards Allowed\", \n    title=\"The Chargers were dominant in their wins and but lost close  \", \n    subtitle=\"Their point differential over the 2010 season ranked 5th in the leauge and ahead of seven playoff teams \", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Joseph Maier\"\n    ) + theme_classic() +  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 8), \n   plot.title.position = \"plot\" ,\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=10), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank() + \n      scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1))\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\nJust by looking at their point differential throughout the season, the 2010 Chargers look like one of the best teams in the league. Most of the playoff teams fall below them on this chart. Of the teams that rank above the Chargers, three of them won at least 12 games. To make things even worse, the 2010 Seahawks, who went 7-9 with a -97 point differential, won their division and made the playoffs.\nA look at the game results from that season shows how the Chargers managed to do this. They started the season 2-5, with all five of their losses coming by one score or less. The Chargers also won five games by 21 points or more, boosting their overall point differential.\nSo why did they lose all those games even with a great offense and defense? Special teams. The 2010 Chargers had one of the worst special teams units of all time. They allowed 3 kick return touchdowns and had four punts blocked, the only team in NFL history to allow those numbers in the same season. There were six games in 2010 in which the Chargers’ special teams contributed to 7 or more expected points for the other team.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=diffworstever, aes(x=Week, y=ExpectedDiff, group=Team), color =\"lightgrey\") +\ngeom_step(data=diffchargers, aes(x=Week, y=ExpectedDiff, group=Team), color =\"#1167b1\") +\n  geom_step(data=diffbrowns, aes(x=Week, y=ExpectedDiff, group=Team), color =\"#FF3C00\") +\n  geom_step(data=difflions, aes(x=Week, y=ExpectedDiff, group=Team), color =\"#58CCED\") +\n  geom_step(data=diffjaguars, aes(x=Week, y=ExpectedDiff, group=Team), color =\"#006778\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x=16, y=60, label= \"2008 Lions\", color= \"#58CCED\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x=14.5, y=28, label= \"2020 Jaguars\", color= \"#006778\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x=16, y=-20, label= \"2017 Browns\", color= \"#FF3C00\") +\n    annotate(\"text\", x=16, y=-70, label= \"2010 Chargers\", color= \"#1167b1\") +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Week\", \n    y=\"Cumulative Special Teams Expected Points Contributed\", \n    title=\"The 2010 Chargers had an all-time bad special teams unit\", \n    subtitle=\"Compared to the 10 worst NFL teams since 1996, the Chargers had the most harmful special teams unit\nby a large margin.

Their failures in the kicking and punting game wasted the best offense and best defense in the league. But what did we expect, its the Chargers."
